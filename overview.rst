Overview
==============

Background 
--------------
**Can we know if a 1000X hardware proposal is feasible?**

* Given target models (e.g., Llama), scenarios (e.g., training and inference) and hardware proposal (e.g., device FLOPS / Mem. bandwidth and interconnect)
* Predict performance and runtime analysis for operators (e.g., compute and communication)

Applications in AI Infrastructure
--------------

* automatic parallelism
* resource scheduling and 
* performance debugging
